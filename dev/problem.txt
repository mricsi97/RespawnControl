I'm unable to set up Games Sign-In in my draft app. I always get error code 12501.

1. I followed the "Setting Up Google Play Games Services" guide (https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling), including making a client ID for my debug key in Play Console.
2. Checking API Console, I have only this single OAuth client registered.
3. I added the debug SHA1 to my app in Firebase, downloaded the google-services.json with this single OAuth entry, put it in <project-path>/app/
4. I put two <meta-data> entries in my manifest: one for app ID, one for google play services version.
5. I've tried running an AVD with these specs: Nexus 5X, API 24 (Google Play).
I've also tried API 24 (Google APIs) AVD.
They give me the 12501 error with DEFAULT_GAMES_SIGN_IN option (which I need for leaderboards later), but they work with DEFAULT_SIGN_IN.
6. I've tried it on my own device as well, with the same results. I checked the CERT.RSA in the generated APK: it contains the debug SHA1.
